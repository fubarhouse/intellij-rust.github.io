## New Features

* Allow modifying loop variable name generated by `iter` postfix template (by [@Voronchikhin])

* Support multiple definitions in `lazy_static` macro call (by [@msmorgan])

* Resolve references to extern crate root in paths without `extern crate` item for 2018 edition

* Group syntax highlighting options (by [@mfarrugi])

* Improve dependency completion in `Cargo.toml`

## Fixes

* Add examples for all postfix templates

are automatically marked as source roots, and `target` folders are excluded from source roots

* Fix name resolution of stdlib macros for nightly stdlib

* Make `Move Statement Up/Down` actions work correctly

* Process global imports in use group while name resolution in proper way

* Partially resolve links which based on re-exported paths in stdlib documentation

* Donâ€™t suggest private items in completion

## Internal Improvements
