## New Features

* Support paths which start with crate name and `crate` keyword for edition 2015. 
See `Module system improvements` section in rust 1.30 
[release notes](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/10/25/Rust-1.30.0.html) for more details

* More convenient work with lldb. Now you can view separate children of `Vec` 
and correct utf-8 values of `&str` and `String` in the debugger tool window. 
Currently, itâ€™s implemented via own lldb formatters. 
You can disable them or switch to default ones in 
`Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | Debugger | Data Views | Rust`

* Implement `Nest use statements` intention

* Extend `Simplify boolean expression` intention for `==` and `!=` operators

* Group imports by semantics while import optimization (by [@isamborskiy])

* Add gutter icon to run benchmarks

* Add annotation for using extern functions and constants outside of `unsafe` block as error (by [@garyttierney])

* Support `vis` macro matcher. See the corresponding [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41022) for more details

## Fixes

* Open project properly via project `Cargo.toml`

* Prevent moving of `use` items outside of  inline module block while import optimization

* Correctly create new test configuration if another one is already created

* More precise resolution of paths in `use` items with the same names

* Fix false positive error annotation in visibility restriction

* Take into account lexical order while name resolution of macros

* Do not mark `'_` lifetime as undeclared

* Expand log macros correctly

* Restore `Show stdout/stderr in tests` option in cargo run configuration. Note, this option disables the test tool window because of the [bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54669) in libtest

* Improve symlinks support. Now name resolution should work correctly if stdlib source path contains symlinks

## Internal Improvements

* Exclude jars related to java support from plugin classpath while building. It should prevent accidental using of java API which leads to `NoClassDefFoundError` in small IDEs like CLion

* Update Kotlin to 1.3.0
