## New Features

* Initial support of raw identifiers. 
See the corresponding [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2151-raw-identifiers.md)

* Improve completion performance

* Implement `Replace .unwrap() with match` intention 
[gif](/assets/posts/changelog-87/unwrap-to-match.gif) (by [@sohich])

* Support custom folding regions [gif](/assets/posts/changelog-87/custom-folding-regions.gif) (by [@garyttierney])

* Improve extend selection for function, struct and trait bodies

* Implement lldb formatters for `Rc`, `Arc`, `Cell`, `RefCell` and `Ref` structs.

* Render enums and tuples better by bundled lldb formatters.
Note, in some cases, enum values can be shown incorrectly because of 
wrong debug info provided by the compiler

* Infer type of some built-in macros like `env`, `stringify`, `include_str`, etc. (by [@kumbayo])

* Show test tool window in debug

## Fixes

* Properly show a result of the first test in test tool window on Windows

* Run single test in debug properly

* Fix running integration test in debug. 

* Take into account params of run configuration template during a creation of cargo run configuration

* Make `Use all features in test` option of `Cargo Command` run configuration disabled by default. 
In case if you would like to make it enabled by default, you should change the corresponding option in  
`Cargo Command` [template](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/changing-default-run-debug-configurations.html)

* Do not take into account extern functions and constants while type name resolution

* Fix false positive `Cannot move` error annotations

* Do not create new run configuration if a suitable one already exists

* Show stdout for failed tests in test tool window

* Identify type mismatch errors for tuples better

* Do not show `Remove parentheses from expression` warning 
for struct literals in for loop iterator (by [@t-kameyama])

* Show `Build` action on MacBook touch bar in CLion

## Internal Improvements

* Land first part of tests for platform test framework integration

* Change project source layout for platform-dependent code to make it possible to write platform-dependent tests
