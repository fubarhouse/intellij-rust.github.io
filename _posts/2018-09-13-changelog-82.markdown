## New Features

* Now `Goto Declaration` action navigates to `derive` meta item if the corresponding trait is implemented via `#[derive]` attribute

* Implement name resolution and completion of paths in include macros and `#[path]` attribute

* Support `Context Info` action

* Show nested items of function in structure view

* Support type hints for generic type parameters (by [@dem1tris])

* Initial implementation of `iter` postfix template (by [@Voronchikhin])

* Implement preliminary inspection of anchored paths for Rust 2018. Note, it’s disabled by default because final design of `use` item paths is not fixed yet

* Create error annotation for [E0404](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html#E0404) error

* Support type inference in [box](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/doc/unstable-book/src/language-features/box-patterns.md) pattern

## Fixes

* Now `Different impl member order from the trait` annotation doesn’t highlight comments and attributes

* Correctly resolve `extern crate` items with dependency on the same crate with a different version

* Fix false positive error highlighting of `Unresolved Reference` inspection for trait objects and generic type parameters

## Internal Improvements

* Implement expression categorization as part of borrow checker implementation

* Various refactorings in tests
