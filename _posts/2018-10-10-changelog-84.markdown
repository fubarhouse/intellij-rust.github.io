This is the last release which supports IDEA 2018.1. If you want to continue to 
receive plugin updates, please upgrade your IDE to 2018.2.

## New Features

* Filter path completion variants by trait bounds

* Implement `Split if` intention. Now you can easily split 
your complex `if` condition into two simplified ones (by [@Dimonchik0036])

* Parse `yield` expression correctly. Note, type inference for such expression is not implemented yet

* Sort completion variants by their types

* Add initial version of `Generate Constructor` action (by [@Voronchikhin])

## Fixes

* Fix `Borrow checker` inspection for tuple fields

* Don't suggest items by auto import quick fix from transitive dependencies

* Filter some irrelevant items from completion variants

* Ignore items from non-lib targets of dependencies while name resolution and completion

* Correctly add `use` item by auto import quick fix in modules with outer attributes like `#[cfg(test)]`

* Improve type inference of struct literals with field shorthand (by [@msmorgan])

* Fix name resolution and completion for items from extern crates in edition 2018

* Fix some false positive `mismatched types` errors

* Improve suggestion of element name in `for` live template

* Improve completion of parenthesis in attributes (by [@nicholastmosher])

* Expand `crate` meta variable in macros correctly
