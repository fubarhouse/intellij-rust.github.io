## New Features

* Add `Needless lifetimes` inspection to check unnecessary lifetimes which can be removed. 
See the corresponding clippy [inspection](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy/wiki#needless_lifetimes)

* Support method separators. You can enable this feature 
via  `Preferences | Editor | General | Appearance | Show method separators` (by [@t-kameyama])

* Add `Assign to immutable` inspection 
which annotates wrong assignments to element or field of the corresponding immutable array or struct

* Support `Inject Language` intention for rust string literals

* Implement new `Show expanded macro` and `Show recursively expanded macro` actions. 
Now you can see how the plugin expands macros

* Validate package name while new project creation

* Implement `Goto definition` action for dependencies in `Cargo.toml`. 
Now it navigates you to `lib.rs` of the corresponding crate

* Support `crate` keyword at the beginning of paths

* Allow attaching cargo project by directory with `Cargo.toml`


## Fixes

* Better completion for partial unknown types

* Fix false positive `Cannot borrow immutable local variable` annotation for index expressions 

* Avoid UI freezes while typing string literals

* Donâ€™t reset run configuration working directory on each reopening `Edit configuration` window

* Correctly process empty groups while macro expansion

* Consider `self` and `Self` as identifiers in macro expansion

* Support parenthesized around bounds like `fn foo<T: (Bar)>(t: T)`


## Internal Improvements

* Update IDEA & CLion. Now 2018.2 platform is default for development

* Initial work on macro expansion in type and pattern context. 
Note, name resolution and type inference are not supposed to work with such macros yet
