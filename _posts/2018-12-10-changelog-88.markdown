## New Features

* Implement `Run Anything` action for Cargo [gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2539310/49729305-2b797f00-fc86-11e8-9881-78fdd72acba8.gif). 
Note, the action is available since 2018.3

* Support `Copyright` plugin [gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2539310/49729454-93c86080-fc86-11e8-9c4d-9712ba0504b9.gif).
Note, the plugin is not available in CLion (see the corresponding [issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-10423))

* Highlight code blocks in quick documentation

* Add formatter setting for indenting where clauses (by [@msmorgan])

## Fixes

* Do not show `Cannot move` error annotation for a copyable type parameter

* Fix grouping of usages in the `Find` tool window (by [@kumbayo])

* Fix parsing of macros and float literals

* Handle method defined by macros better

* Improve `lldb` formatters: correctly print empty `&str`, values of `Ref` and `RefMut` structs, 
as well as `weak` property of `Rc` and `Arc`

* Fix lifetime completion (by [@Dimonchik0036])

* Properly handle explicit `--no-run` parameter in cargo run configuration

## Internal Improvements

* Update IDEA & CLion. Now 2018.3 platform is default for development

* Correctly invalidate caches for Rust language injections
