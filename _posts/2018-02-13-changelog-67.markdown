* Sort `extern crate` items while import optimizing (by [@farodin91])

* Parse [crate visibility](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/doc/unstable-book/src/language-features/crate-visibility-modifier.md)
correctly (by [@mrhota])

* Use short backtraces by default

## Fixes

* Underline only `impl Trait for Type` part of impl by `Different impl member order from the trait` inspection
