This is the last release to support IDEA 2017.2. If you want to continue to 
receive plugin updates, please upgrade your IDE to 2017.3. 


## New Features

* Support `auto` keyword in trait declaration

* Enable type check for references. Note, type check inspection is disabled by default 
because it can generate false positive warnings

* Take into account `path` attribute of parent modules while resolving

* Initial version of import optimizer (by [@farodin91])

* Inspection to check different members order in impl and corresponding trait (by [@t-kameyama]) 

* Infer array size by evaluation of const expression

* Detect `.cargo/config` as toml file


## Fixes

* Allow debugging example binaries

* Use explicit types from function and struct declarations to improve type inference

* Fix indexing of `impl<T> Trait for &T` for more precise method resolution for reference types 

* Improve navigation around const and type in traits (by [@kumbayo])

* Fix quick documentation and breadcrumbs for const and type alias items (by [@kumbayo])

* Resolve types in pattern matching properly

* Allow scrolling content of cargo tool window

* Don't show unnecessary type hints in lambda arguments (by [@farodin91])


## Internal Improvements

* Fix warnings in some quick fixes implementation

* Use `rustfmt-nightly` on appveyor

* Check that all expressions typified in type inference tests 

* Slightly optimize type inference

* Use single objects for integer and float types
